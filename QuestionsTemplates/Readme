This folder contains 6 other files which concern the generated questions and templates used by the 3 approaches during the 3 experiments that we conducted.

Files used by the 1st approach using Algorithm 1 during the 1st experiment:
    - Generated questions: questions1.pdf
    - Templates (Type A/Type B): templates1.pdf

Files used by the 2nd approach using Algorithm 1 during the 2nd experiment:
    - Generated questions: questions2.pdf
    - Templates (Type C): templates2.pdf

Files used by the 3rd approach using Algorithm 1 the 3rd experiment:
    - Generated questions: questions3.pdf
    - Templates (Type D): templates3.pdf
    
 the file templates_complex_2.txt is the updated version of thetemplates that we have used to generate the questions from DH ontologies.
